#### An Extension to https://github.com/Kyubyong/dc_tts.

The purpose of this repo is to test whether a decent audio dataset could be automatically generated based off of a few youtube links. 
In addition, this will serve as an experiment in machine learning for myself. 

The new additions to this project are located in the dataset_generator.py file.

Usage involves feeding in youtube video ids (ex: dQw4w9WgXcQ) for however many videos you want. Final output is a audio dataset that is transcribed in the .csv metadata file alongside accompanying audio clips related to the transcribed text
