#### An Extension to https://github.com/Kyubyong/dc_tts.

The purpose of this repo is to test whether a decent audio dataset could be automatically generated based off of a few youtube links. In addition, this will serve as an experiment in transfter machine learning for myself. 

The new additions to this project are located in the dataset_generator.py file.
